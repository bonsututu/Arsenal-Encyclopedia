# Arsenal-Encyclopedia
This is a project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a final project in my CS 0134 class. This website displays information about the English soccer club Arsenal F.C. The site is targeted towards anyone who is new to the sport of soccer and someone who is looking for a team with a deep history in English soccer.
